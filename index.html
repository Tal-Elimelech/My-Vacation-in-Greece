	<h2>The perfect vacation I took in Greece was planned for a very long time by a group of friends.
    One of the friends is a skipper with whom we planned to rent a yacht in Athens and from there take a cruise to beautiful places in Greece.
	
	
	<br>
	<br>So all the friends flew to Athens</h2>
